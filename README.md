## Project description
* In this project, pressure, temperature and altitude values were measured using BMP180
* The i2c protocol is used as the communication protocol.
* Author: Abdulkadir Erdem
* DEVICE: STM32F429I DISCO1
* IDE: STM32CubeIDE
* HAL

## Connection diagram
* Our pins that are active because we use the I2C1 line.
* PB6 (SCL) and PB7 (SDA) pins.
* stm32f429i disco1 ADXL345
* GND               GND
* 5V                VCC
* SCL               SCL
* SDA               SDA
should be done in such a way that.
